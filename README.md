Simple Notification Component.

Conneted to firebase server ( can be changed in ../src/containers/Notifications/Notification.js )

Supports 3 main types :  text, bonus, promotion.

- When a notification expires will be removed from the notifications list. If they dont have an expiration time, could be removed manualy.

- The menu is opened/closed by a "Notifications (0) 'Bell' " button which shows the number of active notifications. Notifications of type bonus will not be counted in the notification count badge.

- When the API returns new notifications it will be added to the notifications list ( and also marked as 'new').

- When the API returns a response where some notifications are missing will be removed from the list.

- When the API returns new data for a specific notification it will be updated in the list and marked as 'new'.

- Opening and closing the notification menu are animated, as well as adding and removing items in the notification list



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
